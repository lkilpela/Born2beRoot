## 🖥️ About The Project

`Born2beroot` is a project developed as part of the Hive Helsinki curriculum. The goal of this project is to create a virtual machine using Linux, and to set up a variety of system administration tasks.

This project was completed as a **solo project**. It provided an opportunity to learn about system administration, networking, and security in a Linux environment.

### 📚 Features

* Set up a virtual machine with a specific disk layout
* Install and set up a Linux operating system
* Create a strong password policy
* Set up sudo rules
* Create a script for monitoring system resources

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* VirtualBox or similar software to run the virtual machine
* A Linux distribution ISO (Debian Buster was used in this project)

### 🛠️ Installation & Setup

1. Install VirtualBox or similar software on your machine
2. Download the ISO of the Linux distribution you want to use
3. Create a new virtual machine and install the Linux distribution on it
4. Follow the specific system and network configurations required by the `Born2BeRoot` project
