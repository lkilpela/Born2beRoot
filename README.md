## 🖥️ About The Project

`Born2beroot` is a project developed as part of the Hive Helsinki curriculum. The goal of this project is to create a virtual machine using Linux, and to set up a variety of system administration tasks.

This project was completed as a **solo project**. It provided an opportunity to learn about system administration, networking, and security in a Linux environment.

### 📚 Features

* Set up a virtual machine with a specific disk layout
* Install and set up a Linux operating system
* Create a strong password policy
* Set up sudo rules
* Create a script for monitoring system resources

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* VirtualBox or similar software to run the virtual machine
* A Linux distribution ISO (Debian Buster was used in this project)

### 🛠️ Installation & Setup

1. Install VirtualBox or similar software on your machine
2. Download the ISO of the Linux distribution you want to use
3. Create a new virtual machine and install the Linux distribution on it
4. Follow the specific system and network configurations required by the `Born2BeRoot` project

## 📝 Evaluation Requirements

The `Born2beroot` project was evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. **Virtual Machine Setup**: The virtual machine must be correctly set up according to the project specifications.

2. **System Administration**: The system must be configured correctly, including setting up a strong password policy, creating necessary user groups, and setting up sudo rules.

3. **Script Creation**: A script for monitoring system resources must be created and work correctly.

4. **Network Configuration**: The network settings must be configured correctly according to the project specifications.

5. **Documentation**: The project must include a README file that explains how to set up and use the virtual machine.

6. **Code Quality**: The code (for the monitoring script) must be clear, concise, and efficient. It should be well-organized and easy to read.

7. **Compiling**: The project (monitoring script) must compile without any errors or warnings.

### 🧑‍💻 Peer Evaluations (3/3)

Here are some of the comments received during the peer evaluation of the `Born2beRoot` project:

> **Peer 1**: "Everything works and good explanations for everything. Always polite also :) Good luck"

> **Peer 2**: "Lumi did a really great job with this project: not only did she have extensive notes, but she could always give me very detailed explanations about all the concepts we have touched upon. Everything was set up as it was supposed to, and she was confident when using the various commands. I have also learned new things, since often she chose different commands to achieve some things (such as removing the rule for opening port 8080) than I was familiar with. Great and thorough job!"

> **Peer 3**: "Lumi explained each and every command. Her explanation is awesome. I did not found any mistakes is mandatory part. I learned partitions and some commands from her. Good Job!"
